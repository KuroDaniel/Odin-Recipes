            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups half and half (fat free works well!)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper , to taste</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Recipe Steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare vegetables by grating or chopping. Shred cheese and set aside to allow it to come to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Add vegetable broth to a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the carrots, celery and potatoes, cover pot, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender, 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chopped broccoli and simmer for another minutes or two, depending on how chunky or fine you chopped it. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>In a separate skillet over medium heat, sauté onion in 1 tablespoon butter until tender and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Add onion to pot with vegetables. Add remaining 4 tablespoons of butter to the skillet, over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in ¼ c. flour and stir well to make a roux.</li>
            <li>Add the half and half and milk, one cup at a time, stirring constantly. Cook roux, stirring continually with whisk until thickened, smooth and bubbly. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Slowly add rue to the pot of cooked vegetables, stirring carefully to combine. Cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and add grated cheese, stirring until melted. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper or vegetable bouillon base, to taste, if needed.</li>
        </ol>
