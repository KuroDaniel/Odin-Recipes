        <p class="description">This old-fashioned classic banana bread is my favorite recipe that I have been using for nearly a decade! It's the perfect breakfast treat for any season. Made in one bowl with simple ingredients, this the best super soft and moist banana bread with ideal sweet banana flavor.</p>
        <p class="fluff-text">List of ingredients:</p>
        <div class="cool-box">
        <ul class="recipe-list">
            <li>2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp (6 g) baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (116 g) salted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) buttermilk, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="fluff-text">Recipe Steps:</p>
        <ol class="recipe-list">
            <li class="recipe-directions">Preheat the oven to 350° F (177° C). Grease and flour a 9 x 5-inch (23 x 13-cm) loaf pan. Set this aside while you prepare the batter.</li>
            <li class="recipe-directions">In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set this aside for now.</li>
            <li class="recipe-directions">In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Then beat in the eggs, mixing them in one at a time, until they are fully incorporated, about 2 minutes. Whisk in the vanilla.</li>
            <li class="recipe-directions">Gently stir in the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk until the batter just comes together. Then, fold in the mashed banana. Stir with a wooden spoon or spatula until the batter is the consistency of thick pancake batter being careful not over mix.</li>
            <li class="recipe-directions">Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan and bake the bread for 50 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs on it. Let the bread rest in the pan for about 10 minutes before moving it to a wire cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
            <li class="recipe-directions">Slice the banana bread and serve at room temperature. Store the banana bread wrapped in plastic or in an airtight container at room temperature for about 4 to 5 days.</li>
